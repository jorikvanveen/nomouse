Extremely janky wayland version of https://mouseless.click. I'll be using and maintaining this until that app works well enough on wayland.

Currently only supports a single 1920x1080p display, a qwerty keyboard and a compositor with support for the `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1` protocol extension.
Check out [this link](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-virtual-pointer-unstable-v1) to see if your compositor of choice is supported.
